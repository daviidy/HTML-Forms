# HTML-Forms

![screenshot](./images/screenshot.png)

This project is the second in the HTML/CSS module at Microverse
It consists of building an HTML document that matches the appearance of mint.com‚Äôs signup page.

We had a chance to rebuild the form used by Mint.com for signing up new users. They have been highly praised for the design and simplicity of their site, and their signup process is very clean.

The page is very straightforward, so you should be able to clone it even if your CSS skills aren‚Äôt perfect. As usual, don‚Äôt worry about any of the dynamic functionality on the page or finding the specific icons they use or having the form actually submit. The point is to make it look like the real page as much as you reasonably can.

We worked on all the requirements given on this project:

- We used semantic HTML elements for the header, the main content, the form and the footer.
- We styled the elements to look like the real webpage.
